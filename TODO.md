# TODO

- Replace DRF with Django Ninja
- Settle on active record pattern vs selectors and services
- Use env files for compose similar to cookie cutter
- Group requirements and add links to repos see cookie cutter
- Add commands to README.md
  - docker-compose run django pytest
  - http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs
  - http://127.0.0.1:8025 Mailpit
  - Untill we have devcontainer up and running: docker-compose exec django /bin/zsh
- Mailtrap is still used?
- Remove GOOGLE_OAUTH2 stuff
- Share dev environment (some scripts to install venv and tooling or a devcontainer)
