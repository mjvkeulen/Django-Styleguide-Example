# TODO

- Replace DRF with Django Ninja
- Settle on active record pattern vs selectors and services
- Group requirements and add links to repos see cookie cutter
- Add README.md
  - Some commands
    - docker-compose run django pytest
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs
    - http://127.0.0.1:8025 Mailpit
    - Untill we have devcontainer up and running: docker-compose exec django /bin/zsh
- Share dev environment (some scripts to install venv and tooling or a devcontainer)
